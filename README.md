# Tetrahedron Geometry Model (SolidWorks)


## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains a precise 3D model of a regular tetrahedron (Platonic solid) designed using *SolidWorks*. The project demonstrates fundamental geometric modeling techniques, mathematical precision in CAD, and parametric design principles. This equilateral triangular pyramid serves as both an educational resource for geometry studies and a benchmark for CAD proficiency.

The model features mathematically exact dimensions with all edges equal and all faces perfectly equilateral triangles, created using SolidWorks' equation-driven dimensioning and symmetry constraints.

## 🛠️ Software & Tools
* *CAD Software:* SolidWorks
* *Modeling Techniques:* 
  - Equation-driven dimensions
  - Planar sketching with geometric relations
  - Symmetry and mirroring operations
  - Surface modeling for perfect planar faces
* *Visualization:* Realistic rendering with environmental reflections
